# Performance Concerns

If you identify a coding issue that results in sub-optimal performance for one or more compiler/architecture, please use
[godbolt](https://clang.godbolt.org) to create a minimal repro.


# Pull Requests/Forks

Pull Requests are welcome. For small changes, you don't need to do anything special but if you are about to embark on
a large chunk of work or a fork, I encourage you to create an issue so I can try to avoid getting in your way and/or
creating merge-mayhem for your contribution.
